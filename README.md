# CS607 - ADVERSARIAL ML PROJECT
## Defense Mechanism against Super Resolution (SRGAN)

### Original Goal: 
To fail the deepfake detection model by using Super Resolution on Deepfakes to generate adversarial examples.

### Novelty Goal:
To develop a defense mechansim against adversarial attack using Super Resolution.
